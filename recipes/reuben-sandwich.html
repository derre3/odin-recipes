            <h2>What Is a Reuben Sandwich?</h2>
            <p>A Reuben is a grilled sandwich featuring corned beef on rye bread. The Reuben is a menu staple in Jewish-style delicatessens, but it's not technically kosher because it combines meat and cheese.</p>
            <p>A traditional reuben sandwich consists of thinly sliced corned beef, Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut on rye bread slathered with Russian or Thousand Island dressing.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>8 slices rye bread</li>
                <li>Â½ cup Thousand Island dressing</li>
                <li>8 slices Swiss cheese</li>
                <li>8 slices deli sliced corned beef</li>
                <li>1 cup sauerkraut, drained</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <p><li>Preheat a large griddle or skillet over medium heat.</li></p>
                <p><li>Spread one side of bread slices evenly with Thousand Island dressing. On four bread slices, layer one slice Swiss cheese, 2 slices corned beef, 1/4 cup sauerkraut, and a second slice of Swiss cheese. Top with remaining bread slices, dressing-side down. Butter the top of each sandwich.</li></p>
                <p><li>Place sandwiches, butter-side down on the preheated griddle; butter the top of each sandwich with remaining butter. Grill until both sides are golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Serve hot.</li></p>
