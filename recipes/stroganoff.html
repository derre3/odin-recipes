        <h2>What Is Stroganoff?</h2>
        <p>Beef stroganoff is an iconic Russian dish that consists of beef in a creamy sauce. According to legend, it was created by chefs who worked for the <i>Stroganov</i> family in the 1800s. The dish is often made with mushrooms and served over rice or egg noodles.</p>
        <p>Traditional beef stroganoff is made with steak, a roux-based sauce, and sauteed mushrooms. But, as the title suggests, this recipe is simplified. It relies on shortcut ingredients, such as ground beef and canned cream of mushroom soup, to keep the cook time down and to cut down on extra steps.</p>
